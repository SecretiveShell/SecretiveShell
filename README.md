## Hi there! üëã

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate interested in working on Artificial Intelligence, self-hosted software solutions and general automation. I enjoy working on backend technology and experiementing in self hosted environments.

### What I Do üõ†Ô∏è

I mostly work on backed systems related to AI and language modelling, in langauages such as python. 

Most of my open source contributions are related to the model context protocol scene, where I maintain [MCP-Bridge](https://github.com/secretiveShell/mcp-bridge) as a middleware API service. I have a handful of MCP servers including API integrations for [SearXNG](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-searxng) and [Wolfram Alpha](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-wolfram-alpha), as well as locally exposed resources via [MCP-timeserver](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/mcp-timeserver).

### Languages and core technologies.

- **python** + **fastapi** (via [MCP-Bridge](https://github.com/secretiveShell/mcp-bridge))
- **docker** (via [MCP-Bridge](https://github.com/secretiveShell/mcp-bridge) and homelab experiments)
- **C#** and the .NET ecosystem of tooling (via coursework such as [exploding cats game](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/ExplodingKittensCourseWork-y2s1)) 
- **javascript** (via [Rent Management System](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/TMS-coursework-y1s2))
- **PHP** (via [Rent Management System](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/TMS-coursework-y1s2))

### Homelab stack

My current homelab stack runs on a threadripper pc with 3x3090s on arch linux. Core services include:
- vllm (tp over 2x 3090s)
- faster whisper GPU (for the wyoming stack)
- MCP-Bridge
- open web ui
- homeassistant
- zigbee2mqtt
- mosquitto mqtt broker
- adguard home
- jellyfin
- dashy

All services are configured via docker compose with ssl certificates using traefik. Users access the host via a multi user tailnet with properly configured ACLs. 

### I am Interested in Working On üîç

- AI and Machine Learning projects
- Natural language processing and reasoning.
- Automation and agentic workflows.
- Pushing benchmarks with new and innovative ideas.
- Self Hosted/Open source artificial intelligence.

Feel free to connect with me or check out my projects to learn more about what I'm building and exploring!
